# docker-tools
---

This repository collects some bash scripts during my usage of docker. For example, when I need to setup a mysql,  
I just go to the "mysql" directory, and execute the "start.sh" script. Then it is done.  

It saves my time to look up the params of the docker images. 

When I need a new tool, 
1. I just find it from the [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. create a new folder, copy the template startup script
3. update the startup script according the usage of the image.

## Scripts Available

- mysql
- gitlab
- mongodb
